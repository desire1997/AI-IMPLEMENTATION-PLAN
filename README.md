HostEase Dynamic Pricing Implementation Plan

Overview

HostEase is a growing online platform that connects travelers with short-term rental properties in France. To remain competitive in the market, HostEase requires an AI-driven dynamic pricing solution. This project, developed by Team Nexa, outlines the implementation of a machine learning-based pricing model that adjusts rental rates in real time based on demand, seasonality, competitor prices, and external factors.


Objectives

The goal of this project is to integrate a dynamic pricing model into HostEase's ecosystem to:

Optimize revenue and occupancy rates

Automate pricing updates using AI

Ensure competitive pricing against platforms like Airbnb and Booking.com

Leverage data-driven decision-making for pricing strategies

Features

Real-time price adjustments: AI-powered model continuously updates prices based on market demand.

Competitor benchmarking: Web scraping and APIs to track competitor pricing.

User behavior analytics: AI model adjusts pricing based on booking patterns and customer interactions.

Integration with HostEase tools: Price Savant Calendar, Luminous Sorbet UI, and Soft Crepe Dashboard.

Data Sources

The dynamic pricing model relies on multiple data sources:

Internal Data: Historical booking data, customer interactions, and host preferences.

External Data: Competitor prices, seasonal trends, event calendars, and macroeconomic indicators.

Third-Party APIs: Google Trends, OpenWeather, Airbnb Public Data, and Eventbrite.

Social Media & Reviews: Sentiment analysis from platforms like Twitter, TripAdvisor, and Reddit.

Technical Stack

Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM

Data Processing: Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, AWS Redshift, Google BigQuery

Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium

Backend: Python (Flask/Django), RESTful APIs

Frontend: React.js, D3.js for visualizations

Cloud & Hosting: AWS Lambda, AWS S3, Google Cloud Platform
